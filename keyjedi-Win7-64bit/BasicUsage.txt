***Mousless Mode[optional]***
4. Key Jedi can help you overcome your fear of the keyboard
	by disabling the mouse for the currently active application.
	Pressing the special "Mousless" global key (default is ctrl-shift-alt-F12)
	will make sure the mouse can never leave the confines of Key Jedi window
	as long as the application which was selected when the key was pressed is still active.
	For example:
	- Open Visual Studio when Key Jedi is running. Make vs the active app.
	- Press Ctrl-shift-alt-f12
	- Key jedi will tell you you are in mousless mode for vs.
	- your mouse will be "help prisoner" in the bounds of Key Jedi.
	- you will only be able to use your keyboard to operate VS. Use this mode to force yourself to learn keyboard shortcuts instead of using the mouse.
	- If you alt-tab to a different application your mouse will be free.
	- if you alt-tab back to VS, your mouse will lock again.
	- press ctrl-alt-shift-f12 again to regain mouse contorl.
